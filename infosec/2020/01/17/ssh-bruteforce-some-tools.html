<p>Hello guys, in this topic I’ll show you some tools and their commands to start a bruteforce in SSH servers.</p>

<p>Disclaimer:
First of all, it’s good to say that you should not run this kind of tool on servers that you don’t have permission to scan. The risks of doing something like that is at your own.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="brute-force-attack">Brute Force Attack</h2>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<p><em>In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found. Alternatively, the attacker can attempt to guess the key which is typically created from the password using a key derivation function. This is known as an exhaustive key search.</em></p>

<h2 id="our-target-and-stuffs">Our target and “Stuffs”</h2>

<p>I’ve created an Virtualbox VM using Ubuntu 18.04 and installed the OpenSSH. After that, an user <em>admin</em> was added with a kwown password. We will also use a known wordlist to conduct our brute force.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="c"># useradd admin</span>
<span class="c"># passwd admin (using the password "fuckyou")</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Testing our target usign user and password above:</p>

<h2 id="metasploit">Metasploit</h2>

<p>Metasploit is a tool developed by Rapid7 (https://www.metasploit.com/) and used to execute scans, exploits and other pentest phases.</p>

<p>You can have more information about the Framework in the free Offensive Security course at:
(https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/)</p>

<p>Let’s run metasploit to start the brute force in our virtual machine IP address (192.168.56.13).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ msfdb run

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now let’s search for an auxiliary module that should be used to root password guess on this ip address.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/metasploit01.png" alt="Metasploit" /></p>

<p>As we can see in the image above, there is a module <em>auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login</em> that we could use to check for username and password. Let’s chose this one and show its options (command show options).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/metasploit02.png" alt="Metasploit" /></p>

<p>Now we have to change some options to configure the module.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/metasploit03.png" alt="Metasploit" /></p>

<p>We’ve used the rockyou wordlist to configure our brute force. Feel free to use your own wordlist or create a new one. Since we know the username (admin), we just set the password option to use a wordlist. We’ve also changed the threads number to 10 so the process will be faster (locally off course). We’ve setted STOP_ON_SUCCESS so it stops when the password is found. Now, time to RUN!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/metasploit04.png" alt="Metasploit" /></p>

<p>Gotcha! Session 1 was opened after msf discover the password.</p>
