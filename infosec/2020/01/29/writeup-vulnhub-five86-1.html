<p>Hi guys,</p>

<p>Today i am posting my first try to write a walkthrough of a OSCP like machine that i’ve download in vulnhub project.
i’ve chose that machine because it’s intended to be a beginner challenge and it helps a lot to understand how Capture the Flag competitions are made.

<h2 id="vulnhub">Vulnhub</h2>

<p><strong>Aim/Goal</strong></p>

<p>To provide materials that allows anyone to gain practical ‘hands-on’ experience in digital security, computer software &amp; network administration.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/">Vunlnhub Site</a></p>

<h2 id="about-our-target-machine">About our target machine</h2>

<p><em>Description</em></p>

<p>Five86-1 is another purposely built vulnerable lab with the intent of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of this challenge is to get root and to read the one and only flag.</p>

<p>Linux skills and familiarity with the Linux command line are a must, as is some experience with basic penetration testing tools.</p>

<p>For beginners, Google can be of great assistance, but you can always tweet me at @DCAU7 for assistance to get you going again. But take note: I won’t give you the answer, instead, I’ll give you an idea about how to move forward.
Technical Information</p>

<p>Five86-1 is a VirtualBox VM built on Debian 64 bit, but there shouldn’t be any issues running it on most PCs.</p>

<p>Five86-1 has been tested successfully on VMWare Player, but if there are any issues running this VM in VMware, have a read through of this.</p>

<p>It is currently configured for Bridged Networking, however, this can be changed to suit your requirements. Networking is configured for DHCP.</p>

<p>Installation is simple - download it, unzip it, and then import it into VirtualBox or VMWare and away you go.</p>

<p><em>Important</em></p>

<p>While there should be no problems using this VM, by downloading it, you accept full responsibility for any unintentional damage that this VM may cause.</p>

<p>In saying that, there shouldn’t be any problems, but I feel the need to throw this out there just in case.</p>

<p><em>Credits</em></p>

<p>A big thanks goes out to the members of @m0tl3ycr3w.</p>

<p><em>Contact</em></p>

<p>I’m also very interested in hearing how people go about solving these challenges, so if you’re up for writing a walkthrough, please do so and send me a link, or alternatively, follow me on Twitter, and DM me (you can unfollow after you’ve DM’d me if you’d prefer).</p>

<p>I can be contacted via Twitter - @Five86_x</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/five86-1,417/">Download Five86-1 VM</a></p>

<h2 id="tools-and-blogs">Tools and Blogs</h2>

<p>I am using Kali Linux 2019.4 and the new Kali Undercover theme (just to be fashionable lol!)</p>

<p><img src="https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kali-undercover-1.gif" alt="KaliUndercover" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Netdiscover</li>
  <li>Nmap</li>
  <li>Nikto</li>
  <li>Crunch</li>
  <li>Hashcat</li>
  <li>Metasploit</li>
  <li>GTFO Bins</li>
  <li>Rebootuser Blog</li>
  <li>Virtualbox (for labs)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="recon">Recon</h2>

<p>After download and import the VM (i am using Virtualbox), everything configured to run inside the virtualbox private network.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/writeupfive86-1/00a-virtualbox-network.png" alt="VirtualboxNetwork" /></p>

<p>The network configured in Host-only Adapter is 192.168.56.0/24 and the DHCP is enabled.</p>

<p>First step is discover which IP address our target VM got after boot. We will do that using the netdiscover tool.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ netdiscover -i eth1 -r 192.168.56.0/24

-i = interface (using eth1 because my kali linux has two interfaces and eth1 is the Host-only adapter)
-r = range
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/writeupfive86-1/00-netdiscover.png" alt="Netdiscover" /></p>

<p>We can realize that target VM is 192.168.56.15 since the two other IPs are our hypervisor default addresses.
Our Kali Linux machine got 192.168.56.9</p>

<p>The next step is try to discover which services are running on our target. We can do this type of scan using nmap.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ nmap -sC -sV -sT 192.168.56.15
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/writeupfive86-1/01-nmap-recon.png" alt="NmapRecon" /></p>

<p>At this point we have information about a SSH server in port 22, a webserver in port 80 with robots.txt and a disalowed entry to /ona directory (interesting!) and port 10000 running a Webmin version 1.9.20 service.</p>

<p>We can try to pull more details running nikto in port 80.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ nikto -host 192.168.56.15
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/writeupfive86-1/02-nikto-recon.png" alt="Nikto" /></p>

<p>As we can see, nothing new about our target after nikto results.</p>

<p>Let’s try to search some more information about our services versions that we got using google and exploit-db.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/writeupfive86-1/03-exploit-db.png" alt="Exploit-db" /></p>

<p>The first search points to a Webmin vulnerability in version 1.9.20 that brings to an unauthenticated RCE. The exploit is also a Metasploit module that does the things easy to exploit. The only exception is:</p>

<p><em>This module exploits a backdoor in Webmin versions 1.890 through 1.920. Only the SourceForge downloads were backdoored, but they are listed as official downloads on the project’s site.</em></p>

<p>So, the exploit author says the module only works on versions downloaded from sourceforge. It should be a problem if our version were downloaded from apt source or other official not backdoored source. Actually, i’ve tested after finding this infomation and exploit didn’t work, confirming probably the version is not backdoored.</p>

<p><strong>To be Continued! :)</strong></p>
